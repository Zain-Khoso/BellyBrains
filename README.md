# Belly Brains - A ReactJS Learning Journey

**Belly Brains** was my first React Project. I cherish it as one of my best works, not because of it's functionality rather because how quickly I got a grasp of everything. Prior to **Belly Brains** I had never worked with React, Redux, Styled Components or Firebase. Yet I still managed to learn each of those along with completing Belly Brains in two weeks.
