# Belly Brains - A ReactJS Learning Journey

Hey there! Welcome to Belly Brains, a passion project where I'm sharing my experience diving into the realm of ReactJS. This repository acts as a journal tracking my growth as I explore ReactJS concepts and build a evolving hub, for food recipes.

## Project Overview

Belly Brains goes beyond being a repository of recipes; it represents my journey of discovery and experimentation, with ReactJS. As I dive deeper into this framework my goal is to incorporate and demonstrate elements that emphasize the milestones in my learning process.

### Features Implemented

1. **Client-Side Routing:** Move effortlessly between sections of the project using client side routing offering a more interactive and dynamic user experience.

2. **Authentication:** Enhance your security measures by utilizing authentication features, which will guarantee that only individuals, with authorization can gain access to functionalities, within the project.

3. **Email Sending:** Discover the ways to incorporate email sending capabilities by utilizing emailjs, which enhances the user experience with a communication layer.

### Project Concept

Belly Brains is, about being a hub for food recipes. Users have the opportunity to explore a range of recipes and find information, about each dish. This project serves as both a demonstration of ReactJS capabilities and an interactive platform where users can fully indulge in the world and all its delights.
