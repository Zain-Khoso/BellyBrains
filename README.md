# Belly Brains - A ReactJS Learning Journey

Welcome to Belly Brains, a personal project documenting my journey into the exciting world of ReactJS. This repository serves as a log for my progress, featuring the implementation of various ReactJS concepts and the continuous evolution of a food recipe center.

## Project Overview

Belly Brains is more than just a recipe center; it's a reflection of my exploration and experimentation with ReactJS. As I delve deeper into the framework, I aim to implement and showcase key features that highlight my learning milestones.

### Features Implemented

1. **Client-Side Routing:** Navigate seamlessly through different sections of the project with smooth client-side routing, providing a more dynamic user experience.

2. **Authentication with Firebase:** Secure your experience using Firebase authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific functionalities within the project.

3. **State Management with Redux Toolkit:** Efficiently manage the state of the application using Redux Toolkit, providing a centralized store for seamless data flow.

4. **Styling with Styled Components:** Enhance the visual appeal of the project with Styled Components, allowing for modular and dynamic styling of React components.

5. **Image Lazy Loading:** Improve page loading performance by implementing image lazy loading, ensuring that images are loaded only when they come into the viewport.

6. **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** Provide users with the flexibility to choose between light and dark modes, enhancing the overall user experience.

7. **Page Lazy Loading:** Optimize performance by implementing page lazy loading, ensuring that only the necessary components are loaded when navigating through different sections of the project.

### Project Concept

Belly Brains aims to become a globally celebrated food center, offering a diverse array of recipes from around the world. Imagine a platform where users not only discover delightful dishes but can also order them for delivery.
